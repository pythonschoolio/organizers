## How to start a new PythonSchool chapter

**First, open an issue on this repo asking to get added as a chapter organizer**

Your issue should say something like this (not everything is required but it's nice to tell us a little about yourself so you don't come across as a total stranger):

*
Hi, I would like to start a nodeschool chapter for [name of geographic community]. I am [@your twitter name] on twitter and work at/on <name of company or project>. I will be co-organizing this chapter with [names of other organizers]. I have been using Node.js for 6 months and would like to help others learn as well.
*

The chapter name should preferably be the name of the city, where the workshops will
be held. Alternatively the area should be small, but yet meaningful, e.g `princeton` instead of
`new-jersey` or `usa`. Also the repo name should be short and all lowercase.

**An existing Owner will have to respond and create your Chapter repository for you**

Once you are an organizer follow these instructions to set up your NodeSchool chapter:

##### 1 You should have been added to the team called `chapter-organizers` and should have access to edit the new chapter repo, e.g. https://github.com/pythonschoolio/kyiv

##### 2 Each chapter can set up their own gh-pages branch on their org and github pages will automatically route `rubyschoolio/<reponame>` to it
For example we have [Oakland](https://github.com/pythonschoolio/oakland) and [Berlin](https://github.com/pythonschoolio/berlin).
